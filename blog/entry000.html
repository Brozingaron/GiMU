<br />It's alive!
<br />
<br />And by that I mean that GiMU is no longer being hosted on my personal Dropbox account. In case you missed the other 5 links on the site, you can get to GiMU's repo <a href="http://github.com/Brozingaron/GiMU">here</a> or download the current version <a href="https://github.com/downloads/Brozingaron/GiMU/GiMU.zip">here</a>. As I look at the file it has a whopping 0 downloads. At least it's better than the previous version of this website that never made its way to the Internet.
<br />
<br />Dissappointing numbers aside, GiMU has a huge future in its way. It started out as a verbal RPG created in the middle of a hiking trip and is already a semi-functional game. And by semi-functional game, I mean you walk around an island and possibly through the water. As in literally, <i>through</i> the water. I'm working on that.
<br />
<br />There are a lot of plans for GiMU--including Angry Chandeliers and Under the Influence GiMU (GiMUtI if you prefer)--some of which involve <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9bZkp7q19f0">a very popular video on YouTube</a>. And by that I mean that in GiMUtI you dance Gangnam Style instead of sprinting. 
<br />
<br />The reference count only goes up from here if you haven't already noticed.
<br />
<br />At the rate I'm going, expect a GiMUtI alpha to be out by the summer of 2020. Or maybe later.
<br />
<br />Probably later. It really doesn't help having one developer.
<br />
<br />Also, fun fact: the current build of GiMU is not the first build I've given out. It's the third. Can you catch 'em all? It's okay if you can't, they're the same as the current build but they have a different terrain and a tree that emits bright orange particles for literally no reason.
