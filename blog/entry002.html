<p class="postDate">November 11, 2012</p>
<br />I decided to change the development name from Monohedron to Brozingaron. Why you ask? Because we wanted to be <a href="www.google.com/#hl=en&q=brozingaron">hipsters on Google</a>. And no, Brozingaron is not a word in any language. I simply asked somebody to press random buttons on their keyboard in a way that resembeled pronouncable words. This wasn't one of them, but it was really close.

<br />You know what that means. <a href= "../img/logo.png">Logos!</a>

<br />So the build cycle....
<br />
<br />Things are happening. Slowly. Very slowly. Like dead turtule in a pit of tar slowly. But things are happening. I'm currently working on a day/night cycle and a God character. 
<br />
<br />I'm not good at 3D modeling, so I decided to take some creative liberty here.

<br />It's a bit hard to tell from the picture, but there's a smaller black cube inside of the particle emitters. It rotates.

<br />There are a couple of things to wrap up in this build (as in the entire sky) but a new build should be ready eventually. And whenever that happens is when I'll post the first Macntosh build.

<br />Sorry for the vague date, but I don't like deadlines as you can probably tell and I don't want to get peoples' hopes up.
