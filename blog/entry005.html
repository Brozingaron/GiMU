<br />...Has progressed to Pre-Alpha 2. That's right. After only a month and 4 days, the sun rotates. And the sky changes colors. And the clouds move.

<br />My excuse about being a Junior in High School remains sound.
<br />
<br />In all seriousness, this build cycle was a bit weird for me. First, when I started working on it again a few days ago, the game didn't start like it should. You had to pause the game and resume it for the controls to work. None of the code had changed.
<br />
<br />Another weird problem I ran into was the sun. After it reached about 90 degrees into the sky it started to move backwards and seizure about the Y and Z axes. The strobe party was fun while it lasted, though.
<br />
<br />The final problem was a math problem. As in an actual math problem. I had to write a trig equation to calculate on a scale of 0 to 1 how far into the afternoon color the sky should be.

<br />The moral of the story is that you should pay attention in school... And thank your math teachers... Or something...
<br />
<br />... Or you could just go to the <a href="../download/index.html">download page</a> to get the latest release. That works too. There's even a Mac and 64-bit PC version now!

<br />Phase 3 will be underway shortly. And by Phase 3, I mean Pre-Alpha 3. And by underway, I mean including actual water and death screens.
