<br />After a few months of working on GiMU, I'm sorry to say that it's becomming a bit much for me at this point. I've decided to branch out a bit and try something new in Unity, and with that I bring you <a href="http://brozingaron.github.com/Glyph/">Glyph</a>; a unique third person arcade game.
<br />
<br />You can check that out over on its page and get the first Alpha now. Frankly, it's more feature-filled than GiMU is at this point. And by that I mean that there actually is some enjoyment that you can get out of it.
<br />
<br />If you want more information on why I'm putting GiMU on hold it's simply because it was getting complicated to do and I just wasn't getting results I wanted. I've always been much better with 2D images than 3D models and textures, so GiMU was like a new dimension of complexity to me (See what I did there?). Another setback I had was that Unity <i>really</i> likes selling expensive software. To give GiMU decent water I would have to spend $600+ on Unity Pro. I tried making a workaround with some premade mesh animations, but Unity 4.0 doesn't seem to like Blender and I haven't figured out how to get animations to work again (In a recent... well relativley recent--blog post I mentioned that Frigganobb doesn't spin. It still doesn't. I haven't worked that out yet).
<br />
<br />Unity source code for GiMU is still available and will be for the forseeable future. I hope to pick GiMU up again in the future, but until then I'm focusing my spare time on Glyph.
