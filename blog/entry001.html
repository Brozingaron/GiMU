<br />Good news: the new GiMU build is up and includes a pause menu. Ironically for the title, there are only three buttons. Resume, reset and quit. Reset being for when <del>you want to see what happens when you fall out of the world</del> something goes horribly wrong.

<br />There are a couple of other changes, mainly that the icon has changed for smaller sizes so it doesn't just look like an oddly colored blob.
<br />
<br />The download link and source code are both live, and I've taken down pre-alpha 0 and it's entire 0 downloads.

<br />To reddit! (Which also explains why the build cycles are really long)
