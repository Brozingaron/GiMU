<p class="postDate">November 13, 2012</p>
<br />Just a quick post. I've come up with a general list of system requirements.
<br />
<br /><h3>To run GiMU at all, you'll need</h3>
<ul>
<li>A computer, monitor, keyboard and mouse</li>
<li>100MB of free disk space</li>
<li>256MB RAM</li>
<li>A recent CPU</li>
<li>A recent GPU with Direct X 9 Suppport</li>
<li>Windows XP or Mac OS X 10.6 (When the new build comes out)</li>
</ul>
<h3>If you want higher frame rates and graphics settings, you'll want</h3>
<ul>
<li>2GB RAM</li>
<li>A dual-core CPU</li>
<li>A very nice integrated GPU or any dedicated GPU</li>
<li>A GPU that supports Direct X 11</li>
<li>Windows 7 or Mac OS X 10.8</li>
<li>A Mac made within the past 2 years, or one with a really nice GPU</li>
</ul>For 64-bit Windows users, you can download the 64-bit version of the game if you're feeling daring, but the normal x86 version of the game will still run on 64-bit Windows.
<br />Another suggestion I have is a <del>bladder-releasing</del> 1080p display, but it's totally <del>awesome</del> optional.
<br />
<br />These <del>completley scientific</del> tests were performed in a very simple way. We tried the pre-alpha 1 build on a netbook, first-generation MacBook Air, budget laptop, slightly older epic laptop, and a slightly newer epic laptop. The netbook and Macbook Air were the only ones that lagged fullscreen. The others could play full screen with the highest graphics settings. Hooray simplicity!
<br />
<br />Also, don't forget to celebrate <a href="http://redd.it/1326p3" target="_blank">Lemon Tuesday</a>!
