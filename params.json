Although it's similar in style to other RPG games, there are no limits to GiMU except for the incredibly long gaps in the development releases. \r\n\r\n#### Controls\r\nW - Forward\r\nA - Left\r\nS - Back\r\nD - Right\r\nSpace - Jump\r\nShift - Sprint\r\nEscape - Pause\r\n\r\n#### What can you do?\r\nFor right now, the game is in a very early pre-alpha stage so basically you can walk around an island and fall through the world. In the final release, though, you'll be able to do basically anything. There's no real plot so the game is endless.\r\n\r\n#### What does GiMU mean?\r\nThat's not important right now.\r\n\r\n#### So basically it's Skyrim?\r\nNo. GiMU doesn't have arrows or knees to take said arrows to. (For now)","name":"GiMU"}
